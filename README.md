## üìù Project Overview

This project aims to build classification models that analyze tweet content to determine whether it is related to **technology** or **politics**. Using annotated tweets, we applied machine learning techniques in Python to evaluate different types of features: lexical (TF-IDF), sentiment-based (TextBlob), and structural (punctuation, capitalization, etc.).
